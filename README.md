# Miami Feud (adaptation of Family Feud) - Turing Mod 2 Group Project

## About
Standard Family Feud with a great Miami twist. We took the theme of miami vice and decided it would be a great game. A player is given a survey from a dataset of 15 sureveys and is expected to guess the most popular resonses. There are two standard rounds and a fast money round where both players will guess the answers of a survey for 30 seconds. If the first player does not guess all three answers, the second player will get a chance too and then answer their own. Winner is determined by most points
